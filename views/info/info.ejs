             <h1>About</h1>
             <p>
                  Thank you for being part of PMer!
             </p>

                The idea of this website is to provide a platform to share
                <strong>one photo one day with one memory</strong>. We might 
                take tons of photos for one event, one place, one person, etc.
                However, there must be one and the only that becomes our favorite.
                Each photo is a memory chip connecting the future and the past. 
                Brain memories might fade but photo memories last. Hope you enjoy 
                exploring and sharing your own photo momories.

                 I have been working as a senior credit analyst for the past three 
                 years, but I can never forget the happiness and the joy that programming 
                 brings to me when solving quadratic equation problems during my 7th grade.
                 The desire to learn programming grows stronger since I relocated to Silicon 
                 Valley. I am so ready to explore software engineering industry and make the world better!!!
